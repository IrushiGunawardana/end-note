    <h1>Have a Safe Flight, Sineth!</h1>
    <p>I will miss the Sineth I met on two years ago. Letting you go was the one of the hardest thing I did in my life. So this is my final note to you. Have a safe flight and a beautiful journey ahead. Meeting you was yeah I would called it destiny on that day.
    
    We may not cross paths again, so I won’t be there with you anymore. Please take care of your health and make sure you’re eating well. Most importantly, live a happy life, and pursue the dreams that mean the most to you.
    
    This is the first photo we took together, so I’m sending it along with this message. I hope your eyes sparkle just as brightly someday as they did then.
    <br>
    Goodbye, Sineth. Irushi will be stopping here. Fly safe.</p>
